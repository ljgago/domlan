#
# This file is only relevant if you are using git.
#
# Files which match the splat patterns below will
# be ignored by git.  This keeps random crap and
# and sensitive credentials from being uploaded to 
# your repository.  It allows you to configure your
# app for your machine without accidentally
# committing settings which will smash the local 
# settings of  other developers on your team. 
#
# Some reasonable defaults are included below,
# but, of course, you should modify/extend/prune
# to fit your needs!

# Local Configuration
#
# Explicitly ignore files which contain:
#
# 1. Sensitive information you'd rather not push to
#    your git repository.
#    e.g., your personal API keys or passwords.
#
# 2. Environment-specific configuration
#    Basically, anything that would be annoying
#    to have to change every time you do a 
#    `git pull`
#    e.g., your local development database, or
#    the S3 bucket you're using for file uploads
#    development.
